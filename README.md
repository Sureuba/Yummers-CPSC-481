If you want to run the file yourself, you should download the repository and extract the contents from the zip.
Ensure that the asset folder is in the same directory as the html file, then open the html file with your browser. Some of the pictures may not work if only the html file is ran, 
so it is better to run the code form an IDE like VScode and run the html using the live server extension.
